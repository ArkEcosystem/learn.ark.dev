# Welcome To ARK Learning Hub

## Purpose

This is the ARK Learning Hub where Developer Guidebooks and Tutorials will be listed. ARK Learning Hub is here to help you learn blockchain application development on top of modular ARK Core technology platform. After mastering the guides and tutorials listed here, you'll be ready to build your own ARK-powered applications and blockchains. **Welcome and happy coding.**

## What is ARK?

The ARK Ecosystem allows blockchain developers to customize a sovereign blockchain complete with required feature sets. ARKâ€™s value proposition lies in the array of services offered through the ARK Blockchain Platform. 

{% hint style="info" %}
These services include interconnection with different blockchains, seamless integration of custom business logic, flexible development of tailored transaction types, and access to a global, community support system - all rooted in an intuitive development experience.
{% endhint %}

**It is not an ERC-20 token, but is a platform built from ground up with speed, stability and a modular design for future improvements and connectivity.** ARK has quietly been at work building an actual modular platform that empowers you to easily deploy your own blockchain, build blockchain applications and interconnect with other blockchains, all with our easy to use tools and SDKs. 

The guidebook contains some technical references and in coding tutorials that might overwhelm beginners. ARK community developers and the ARK Team can be contacted on [slack](https://ark.io/slack). Do not hesitate to contact us, even if you feel the question is quite stupid and would inconvenience us. Also feel free to look into the key concepts explaining transaction types, cryptography and core server running modes \(links below and in the sidebar\).
