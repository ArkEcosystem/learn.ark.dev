# Welcome to ARK Ecosystem

This is the ARK Ecosystem Developer Guidebook and Tutorials page. After reading this, you'll be ready to build your own ARK-powered applications and blockchains -- perhaps with the help of some code from our tutorials.

The guidebook contains some technical references and in coding tutorials that might overwhelm beginners. ARK community developers and the ARK Team can be contacted on [slack](https://ark.io/slack). Do not hesitate to contact us, even if you feel the question is quite stupid and would inconvenience us.
