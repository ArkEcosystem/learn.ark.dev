# Welcome to ARK Ecosystem

## Purpose

This is the ARK Ecosystem Developer Guidebook and Tutorials page. After reading this, you'll be ready to build your own ARK-powered applications and blockchains -- perhaps with the help of some code from our tutorials.

## What is ARK?

The ARK Ecosystem allows blockchain developers to customize a sovereign blockchain complete with required feature sets. ARKâ€™s value proposition lies in the array of services offered through the ARK Blockchain Platform. These services include interconnection with different blockchains, seamless integration of custom business logic, flexible development of tailored transaction types, and access to a global, community support system - all rooted in an intuitive development experience.

It is not an ERC-20 token, but is a platform built from ground up with speed, stability and a modular design for future improvements and connectivity. ARK has quietly been at work building actual products that allow you to easily deploy your own blockchain, build blockchain application and interconnect with other blockchains, all with easy to use tools.

The guidebook contains some technical references and in coding tutorials that might overwhelm beginners. ARK community developers and the ARK Team can be contacted on [slack](https://ark.io/slack). Do not hesitate to contact us, even if you feel the question is quite stupid and would inconvenience us.
