# Development Environment Setup

## Introduction

ARK Core is written in [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript), and it has been using [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) to manage the development and publication of its packages and uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) as execution environment. 

This guide will take you through the basic steps of setting up a development environment. We recommend Linux \(\*.deb based\) operating system as the default environment.

If you don't have access to a Linux box you can quickly setup one on [DigitalOcean](https://cloud.digitalocean.com) by using this 50$ referral link: [https://m.do.co/c/09d061526b12](https://m.do.co/c/09d061526b12).
